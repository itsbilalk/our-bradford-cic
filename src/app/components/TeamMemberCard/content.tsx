            make a difference. I also bring administrative and problem solving

            With over 20 years of experience across a variety of industries, I
            have built a career that combines operational leadership, programme
            and project management, and meaningful community impact. My
            professional journey has included leading teams of over 1,000
            employees, managing complex contractual agreements with government
            bodies and charities, and serving as a trusted partner to national
            charities, local authorities, and major organisations. As CEO, I
            have received industry-wide recognition for driving large-scale
            initiatives such as the UK’s digital switchover awareness campaign,
            while consistently strengthening partner and client relationships
            through effective strategy and delivery.

            mentor on the Prince’s Trust ex-offender programme, where my work
            was recognised by King Charles. I also serve as an executive
            advisory board member for the BT Muslim Network, reflecting my
            commitment to diversity, inclusion, and social impact. A qualified

            roles, underlining my ability to inspire, guide, and deliver results
